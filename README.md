# Simple Blackjack Game
This project is a simple blackjack game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows players to play the classic card game of blackjack against the computer. The game logic is implemented in JavaScript, while HTML and CSS are used for the user interface.

## Game Flow:
At the beginning of the game, the player is prompted to enter their name and chips. The player's name and chip count are displayed on the screen.

To start the game, the player clicks the "Start Game" button. Two random cards are dealt to the player, and their sum is calculated. The player's cards and the current sum are displayed.

The player then has the option to click the "New Card" button to receive an additional card. The sum is updated, and the new card is displayed. The player can continue to request new cards until they reach a sum of 21 or exceed it.

If the player's sum is less than or equal to 20, a message is displayed asking if they want a new card. If the sum is exactly 21, the player wins with a blackjack, and a corresponding message is displayed. If the sum exceeds 21, the player is out of the game, and a message is displayed accordingly.

## Getting Started:
To play the blackjack game, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. Enter your name and chip count, then click the "Start Game" button. Use the "New Card" button to request additional cards. Pay attention to the messages displayed, indicating your current game status.
